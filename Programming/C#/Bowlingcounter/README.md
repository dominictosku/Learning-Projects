Prerequisites

    .NET 8 SDK
    Visual Studio (optional)

Installation

Build the project:

bash

    dotnet build

Usage

Running the Application

There are two projects:

BowlingCounter is for the console application

BowlingServer is for the web version, the port will be shown in the console

I advise using BowlingServer for the web version, as it is more advanced

To run the application, switch to either the BowlingCounter or BowlingSever directory and use the following command:

bash

    dotnet build
